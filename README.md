### Saves the state of teamwater so i can make a graph over it after the month

I wanted to store the amount of money raised for teamWater at some interval, so i just listened to the websocket that sends the updates and writes it to a file.

The websocket sends a very large amount of unnecessary repeated data, and i write all of it down, so it wastes a lot of storage space, but ehh..

Dont look at the code and especially dont run it and look at the output, it might be even more wasteful than the data sent over the websocketðŸ’€
